# Classification of Emails Using Artificial Intelligence

This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning model for classifying emails based on their content. The project was developed as part of my final year project in computer science, and aims to showcase my skills in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing.

## Overview

The primary goal of this project is to create an efficient and accurate email classification system that can automatically categorize incoming emails into different folders or tags, based on their content. This system can help users manage their email inboxes more effectively and save time by filtering out irrelevant or spam messages.

The project is implemented in Python, and it leverages various machine learning and natural language processing techniques, such as:
- Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming)
- Feature extraction (TF-IDF)
- Model training and evaluation (using algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forest)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the project, you need to have Python 3.x installed along with the following libraries:
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- nltk

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/braun-devwtf/Classification-of-emails-using-artificial-intelligence.git
